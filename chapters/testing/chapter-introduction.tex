\chapter{Testing}\label{cptr:testing}

In this chapter, I would like to mention process of validation the application correctness.
For users, the key feature of the migrator tool is the migration context overview.

I will briefly mention main cases which may occur.
Then, I will demonstrate a migration use-case, where mentioned cases will be proven as correct.

\todo{Change description to not include the result.}
