\section{Data Stewardship Wizard}

As has been already stated, the DSW application is being developed in cooperation of ELIXIR CZ and ELIXIR NL research groups.
The development is currently split into multiple independent parts.

The whole system is available as an open-source\footnote{Application repositories are available at GitHub under the organization page at https://github.com/ds-wizard.}.
That said, the source code, documentation, and the development process are publicly accessible and open to contribution.

The most significant part of the project is the server application called DSW-Server (in \gls{dsw} terminology called \textit{portal}).
This application implements all the functionality and business logic of the system.
Using standard terminology, we can refer to it as a backend.

Since the portal application does not provide any \gls{ui} (it only exposes \glsentryshort{api} using \glsentryshort{rest} standard), there is an complementary web application called DSW-Client (or, in \gls{dsw} terminology, called just \textit{client} for short) which does just that.
Using standard terminology, such application is refered to as a frontend.

\todo{Make sure the server part description and development state are both correct}
