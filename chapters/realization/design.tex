\section{Design}\label{sec:design}

In this section, I will acquaint the reader with final application design.
The application design was chosen in such way, so it is consistent with the rest of the application.

I reused existing \gls{ui} components such as modal windows, buttons and color shades so user will feel familiar while using the new migration tool.
The final design is shown on figures \ref{fig:des-1} to \ref{fig:des-5}.

\altimage[0.9\textwidth]{fig:des-1}{The upgrade action is only visible when there is available migration}{Available migration notification}{des-1.png}
