\section{Design}\label{sec:design}

In this section, I will acquaint the reader with the final application design.
The application design was chosen in such a way, so it is consistent with the rest of the application.

The existing \gls{ui} components such as modal windows, buttons and color shades were reused, so the user will feel familiar while using the new migration tool.
The final design is shown in figures \ref{fig:des-1} to \ref{fig:des-5}.
