This thesis deals with the analysis and implementation of the data management plans migration tool.
The application module for the existing system Data Stewardship Wizard is designed, based on the requirements and analysis.
The thesis reflects the standard software development process and includes analysis, design, realization, and testing.
The output of the implementation part is modules for both server and client application, allowing to migrate existing plans to a newer version of a Knowledge Model.
